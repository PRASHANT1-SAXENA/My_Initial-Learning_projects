      "He was running along in\r\n",
      "the grass, poking his nose into everything and looking with his two eyes\r\n",
      "all about, when he saw a smooth, shiny acorn, lying in the grass.\n",
      "It was\r\n",
      "such a fine shiny little acorn that he thought he would take it home\r\n",
      "with him; so he put out his paw to touch it, but the little acorn rolled\r\n",
      "away from him.\n",
      "He ran after it, but it kept rolling on, just ahead of\r\n",
      "him, till it came to a place where a big oak-tree had its roots spread\r\n",
      "all over the ground.\n",
      "Then it rolled under a big round root.\n",
      "Little Mr Field Mouse ran to the root and poked his nose under after the\r\n",
      "acorn, and there he saw a small round hole in the ground.\n",
      "He slipped\r\n",
      "through and saw some stairs going down into the earth.\n",

      "rolling down, with a soft tapping sound, ahead of him, so down he went\r\n",
      "too.\n",

      "Field Mouse, until suddenly he saw a tiny door at the foot of the\r\n",
      "stairs.\n",
      "The shiny acorn rolled to the door and struck against it with a tap.\n",
      "Quickly the little door opened and the acorn rolled inside.\n",
      "The Field\r\n",
      "Mouse hurried as fast as he could down the last stairs, and pushed\r\n",
      "through just as the door was closing.\n",
      "It shut behind him, and he was in\r\n",
      "a little room.\n",
      "And there, before him, stood a queer little Red Man!\n",
      "He\r\n",
      "had a little red cap, and a little red jacket, and odd little red shoes\r\n",
      "with points at the toes.\n",
      "\"You are my prisoner,\" he said to the Field Mouse.\n",

      "Where it was\r\n",
      "he didn't know, so he looked everywhere.\n",
      "He opened every little drawer\r\n",
      "and looked in, but it wasn't in any of the drawers; he peeped on every\r\n",
      "shelf, but it wasn't on a shelf; he hunted in every closet, but it\r\n",
      "wasn't in there.\n",
      "Finally, he climbed up on a chair and opened a wee, wee\r\n",
      "door in the chimney-piece,--and there it was!\n",
      "He took it quickly in his forepaws, and then he took it in his mouth,\r\n",
      "and then he ran away.\n",
      "He pushed open the little door; he climbed up, up,\r\n",
      "up the little stairs; he came out through the hole under the root; he\r\n",
      "ran and ran through the fields; and at last he came to his own house.\n",
      "When he was in his own house he set the shiny acorn on the table.\n",
      "I\r\n",
      "expect he set it down hard, for all at once, with a little snap, it\r\n",
      "opened!--exactly like a little box.\n",
      "And what do you think!\n",
      "There was a tiny necklace inside!\n",
      "It was a most\r\n",
      "beautiful tiny necklace, all made of jewels, and it was just big enough\r\n",
      "for a lady mouse.\n",
      "So the little Field Mouse gave the tiny necklace to\r\n",
      "his little Mouse-sister.\n",
      "She thought it was perfectly lovely.\n",
      "And when\r\n",
      "she wasn't wearing it she kept it in the shiny acorn box.\n",

      "couldn't catch the little Red Hen, because she was too wise for him.\n",
      "Every time she went out to market she locked the door of the house\r\n",
      "behind her, and as soon as she came in again she locked the door behind\r\n",
      "her and put the key in her apron pocket, where she kept her scissors and\r\n",

      "After this, the little Jackal did not like to risk going near the water,\r\n",

      "his back showed through.\n",
      "The little Jackal did not wait for a second look.\n",

      "So\r\n",
      "he crept and crawled over the ground till he came to the little Jackal's\r\n",

      "house, to wait till the little Jackal should come home.\n",
      "By and by the little Jackal came dancing home, happy and free from\r\n",
      "care,--_but_ looking all around.\n",

      "So he put\r\n",
      "on as pleasant a voice as he could (which is not saying much) and\r\n",

      "first I must gather some firewood for dinner.\"\n",
      "Then he went and gathered firewood, and more firewood, and more\r\n",
      "firewood; and he piled it all up solid against the door and round the\r\n",

      "heard of, because they were very rich in everything except money.\n",
      "They\r\n",
      "had a wonderful, wise father, who knew stories to tell, and who taught\r\n",
      "them their lessons in such a beautiful way that it was better than play;\r\n",
      "they had a lovely, merry, kind mother, who was never too tired to help\r\n",
      "them work or watch them play; and they had all the great green country\r\n",
      "to play in.\n",
      "There were dark, shadowy woods, and fields of flowers, and a\r\n",
      "river.\n",
      "And there was a big barn.\n",
      "One of the little girls was named Louisa.\n",
      "She was very pretty, and ever\r\n",
      "so strong; she could run for miles through the woods and not get tired.\n",
      "She had a splendid brain in her little head; it liked study, and it\r\n",
      "thought interesting thoughts all day long.\n",
      "Louisa liked to sit in a corner by herself, sometimes, and write\r\n",
      "thoughts in her diary; all the little girls kept diaries.\n",
      "She liked to\r\n",
      "make up stories out of her own head, and sometimes she made verses.\n",
      "When the four little sisters had finished their lessons, and had helped\r\n",
      "their mother wash up and sew, they used to go to the big barn to play;\r\n",
      "and the best play of all was theatricals.\n",
      "Louisa liked theatricals\r\n",
      "better than anything.\n",
      "They made the barn into a theatre, and the grown-up people came to see\r\n",
      "the plays they acted.\n",
      "They used to climb up on the hay-loft for a stage,\r\n",
      "and the grown people sat in chairs on the floor.\n",
      "It was great fun.\n",
      "One\r\n",
      "of the plays they acted was _Jack and the Beanstalk_.\n",
      "They had a ladder\r\n",
      "from the floor to the loft, and on the ladder they tied a vine all the\r\n",
      "way up to the loft, to look like the wonderful beanstalk.\n",
      "One of the\r\n",
      "little girls was dressed up to look like Jack, and she acted that part.\n",
      "When it came to the place in the story where the giant tried to follow\r\n",
      "Jack, the little girl cut down the beanstalk, and down came the giant\r\n",
      "tumbling from the loft.\n",
      "The giant was made out of pillows, with a great,\r\n",
      "fierce head of paper, and funny clothes.\n",
      "Another story that they acted was _Cinderella_.\n",
      "They made a wonderful\r\n",
      "big pumpkin out of the wheelbarrow, trimmed with yellow paper, and\r\n",
      "Cinderella rolled away in it, when the fairy godmother waved her wand.\n",
      "One other beautiful story they used to play.\n",
      "It was the story of\r\n",
      "_Pilgrim's Progress_; if you have never heard it, you must be sure to\r\n",
      "read it as soon as you can read well enough to understand the\r\n",
      "old-fashioned words.\n",
      "The little girls used to put shells in their hats\r\n",
      "for a sign they were on a pilgrimage, as the old pilgrims used to do;\r\n",
      "then they made journeys over the hill behind the house, and through the\r\n",
      "woods, and down the lanes; and when the pilgrimage was over they had\r\n",
      "apples and nuts to eat, in the happy land of home.\n",
      "Louisa loved all these plays, and she made some of her own and wrote\r\n",
      "them down so that the children could act them.\n",
      "But better than fun or writing Louisa loved her mother, and by and by,\r\n",
      "as the little girl began to grow into a big girl, she felt very sad to\r\n",
      "see her dear mother work so hard.\n",
      "She helped all she could with the\r\n",
      "housework, but nothing could really help the tired mother except money;\r\n",
      "she needed money for food and clothes, and someone grown up, to help in\r\n",

      "But there never was enough money for these things, and\r\n",
      "Louisa's mother grew more and more weary, and sometimes ill.\n",
      "I cannot\r\n",
      "tell you how much Louisa suffered over this.\n",
      "At last, as Louisa thought about it, she came to care more about helping\r\n",
      "her mother and her father and her sisters than about anything else in\r\n",
      "all the world.\n",
      "And she began to work very hard to earn money.\n",
      "She sewed\r\n",
      "for people, and when she was a little older she taught some little girls\r\n",
      "their lessons, and then she wrote stories for the papers.\n",
      "Every bit of\r\n",
      "money she earned, except what she had to use, she gave to her dear\r\n",
      "family.\n",

      "Every year she grew more unselfish, and every year she worked harder.\n",
      "She liked writing stories best of all her work, but she did not get much\r\n",

      "white beds in it, of children propped up on pillows in the beds, and of\r\n",
      "other children in great wheeled chairs, and others hobbling about or\r\n",
      "sitting in little chairs.\n",

      "nothing around him.\n",
      "Now, you know, a Camel is very big, and a Jackal is very little.\n",

      "America in big covered wagons with many horses, and finally succeeded in\r\n",
      "climbing to the top of the great Rockies and down again into a valley in\r\n",
      "the very midst of the mountains.\n",
      "It was a valley of brown, bare, desert\r\n",
      "soil, in a climate where almost no rain falls; but the snow on the\r\n",
      "mountain-tops sent down little streams of pure water, the winds were\r\n",
      "gentle, and lying like a blue jewel at the foot of the western hills was\r\n",
      "a marvellous lake of salt water,--an inland sea.\n",
      "So the pioneers settled\r\n",
      "there and built themselves huts and cabins for the first winter.\n",
      "It had taken them many months to make the terrible journey; many had\r\n",
      "died of weariness and illness on the way; many died of hardship during\r\n",
      "the winter; and the provisions they had brought in their wagons were so\r\n",
      "nearly gone that, by spring, they were living partly on roots, dug from\r\n",
      "the ground.\n",
      "All their lives now depended on the crops of grain and\r\n",
      "vegetables which they could raise in the valley.\n",
      "They made the barren\r\n",
      "land fertile by spreading water from the little streams over it,--what\r\n",
      "we call \"irrigating\"; and they planted enough corn and grain and\r\n",
      "vegetables for all the people.\n",
      "Every one helped, and every one watched\r\n",
      "for the sprouting, with hopes, and prayers, and careful eyes.\n",

      "Then a terrible thing happened.\n",
      "One day, the men who were watering the\r\n",

      "edge of the gardens nearest the mountains.\n",
      "They were hopping from the\r\n",
      "barren places into the young, green crops, and as they settled down they\r\n",
      "ate the tiny shoots and leaves to the ground.\n",
      "More came, and more, and\r\n",
      "ever more, and as they came they spread out till they covered a big\r\n",

      "The men tried to kill the crickets by beating them down, but the\r\n",
      "numbers were so great that it was like beating at the sea.\n",
      "Then they ran\r\n",
      "and told the terrible news, and all the village came to help.\n",
      "They\r\n",
      "started fires; they dug trenches and filled them with water; they ran\r\n",

      "large voice for so small a creature!\"\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" said the little girl, \"that is just a cow, mooing.\"\n",
      "A little farther on they heard some bullfrogs, in a swamp.\n",
      "\"Surely that\r\n",
      "is the Nightingale,\" said the courtiers; \"it really sounds like\r\n",
      "church-bells!\"\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" said the little girl, \"those are bullfrogs, croaking.\"\n",
      "At last they came to the wood where the Nightingale was.\n",
      "\"Hush!\"\n",
      "said\r\n",
      "the little girl, \"she is going to sing.\"\n",
      "And, sure enough, the little\r\n",
      "Nightingale began to sing.\n",
      "She sang so beautifully that you have never\r\n",
      "in all your life heard anything like it.\n",
      "\"Dear, dear,\" said the courtiers, \"that is very pleasant; does that\r\n",
      "little grey bird really make all that noise?\n",
      "She is so pale that I think\r\n",
      "she has lost her colour for fear of us.\"\n",
      "The Chamberlain asked the little Nightingale to come and sing for the\r\n",
      "Emperor.\n",
      "The little Nightingale said she could sing better in her own\r\n",
      "greenwood, but she was so sweet and kind that she came with them.\n",
      "That evening the palace was all trimmed with the most beautiful flowers\r\n",
      "you can imagine, and rows and rows of little silver bells, that tinkled\r\n",
      "when the wind blew in, and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of wax\r\n",
      "candles, that shone like tiny stars.\n",
      "In the great hall there was a gold\r\n",
      "perch for the Nightingale, beside the Emperor's throne.\n",
      "When all the people were there, the Emperor asked the Nightingale to\r\n",
      "sing.\n",
      "Then the little grey Nightingale filled her throat full, and sang.\n",
      "And, my dears, she sang so beautifully that the Emperor's eyes filled up\r\n",
      "with tears!\n",
      "And, you know, emperors do not cry at all easily.\n",
      "So he\r\n",
      "asked her to sing again, and this time she sang so marvellously that\r\n",
      "the tears came out of his eyes and ran down his cheeks.\n",
      "That was a great\r\n",
      "success.\n",
      "They asked the little Nightingale to sing, over and over again,\r\n",
      "and when they had listened enough the Emperor said that she should be\r\n",
      "made \"Singer in Chief to the Court.\"\n",
      "She was to have a golden perch near\r\n",
      "the Emperor's bed, and a little golden cage, and was to be allowed to go\r\n",
      "out twice every day.\n",
      "But there were twelve servants appointed to wait on\r\n",
      "her, and those twelve servants went with her every time she went out,\r\n",
      "and each of the twelve had hold of the end of a silken string which was\r\n",
      "tied to the little Nightingale's leg!\n",
      "It was not so very much fun to go\r\n",
      "out that way!\n",
      "For a long, long time the Nightingale sang every evening to the Emperor\r\n",
      "and his court, and they liked her so much that the ladies all tried to\r\n",
      "sing like her; they used to put water in their mouths and then make\r\n",
      "little sounds like this: _glu-glu-glug_.\n",
      "And when the courtiers met each\r\n",
      "other in the halls, one would say \"Night,\" and the other would say\r\n",
      "\"ingale,\" and that was supposed to be conversation.\n",
      "At last, one day, there came a little package to the Emperor, on the\r\n",
      "outside of which was written, \"The Nightingale.\"\n",
      "Inside was an\r\n",
      "artificial bird, something like a Nightingale, only it was made of gold,\r\n",
      "and silver, and rubies, and emeralds, and diamonds.\n",
      "When it was wound\r\n",
      "up it played a waltz tune, and as it played it moved its little tail up\r\n",
      "and down.\n",
      "Everybody in the court was filled with delight at the music of\r\n",
      "the new nightingale.\n",
      "They made it sing that same tune thirty-three\r\n",
      "times, and still they had not had enough.\n",
      "They would have made it sing\r\n",
      "the tune thirty-four times, but the Emperor said, \"I should like to hear\r\n",
      "the real Nightingale sing, now.\"\n",
      "But when they looked about for the real little Nightingale, they could\r\n",
      "not find her anywhere!\n",
      "She had taken the chance, while everybody was\r\n",
      "listening to the waltz tunes, to fly away through the window to her own\r\n",
      "greenwood.\n",
      "\"What a very ungrateful bird!\"\n",
      "said the lords and ladies.\n",
      "\"But it does\r\n",
      "not matter; the new nightingale is just as good.\"\n",
      "So the artificial nightingale was given the real Nightingale's little\r\n",
      "gold perch, and every night the Emperor wound her up, and she sang waltz\r\n",
      "tunes to him.\n",
      "The people in the court liked her even better than the old\r\n",
      "Nightingale, because they could all whistle her tunes,--which you can't\r\n",
      "do with real nightingales.\n",
      "About a year after the artificial nightingale came, the Emperor was\r\n",
      "listening to her waltz tune, when there was a _snap_ and _whir-r-r_\r\n",
      "inside the bird, and the music stopped.\n",
      "The Emperor ran to his doctor,\r\n",
      "but he could not do anything.\n",
      "Then he ran to his clock-maker, but he\r\n",
      "could not do much.\n",
      "Nobody could do much.\n",
      "The best they could do was to\r\n",
      "patch the gold nightingale up so that it could sing once a year; even\r\n",
      "that was almost too much, and the tune was very shaky.\n",
      "Still, the\r\n",
      "Emperor kept the gold nightingale on the perch in his own room.\n",
      "A long time went by, and then, at last, the Emperor grew very ill, and\r\n",
      "was about to die.\n",
      "When it was sure that he could not live much longer,\r\n",
      "the people chose a new emperor and waited for the old one to die.\n",
      "The\r\n",
      "poor Emperor lay, quite cold and pale, in his great big bed, with velvet\r\n",
      "curtains and tall candlesticks all about.\n",
      "He was quite alone, for all\r\n",
      "the courtiers had gone to congratulate the new emperor, and all the\r\n",
      "servants had gone to talk it over.\n",
      "When the Emperor woke up, he felt a terrible weight on his chest.\n",
      "He\r\n",
      "opened his eyes, and there was Death, sitting on his heart.\n",
      "Death had\r\n",
      "put on the Emperor's gold crown, and he had the gold sceptre in one\r\n",
      "hand, and the silken banner in the other; and he looked at the Emperor\r\n",
      "with his great hollow eyes.\n",
      "The room was full of shadows, and the\r\n",
      "shadows were full of faces.\n",
      "Everywhere the Emperor looked, there were\r\n",
      "faces.\n",
      "Some were very, very ugly, and some were sweet and lovely; they\r\n",
      "were all the things the Emperor had done in his life, good and bad.\n",
      "And\r\n",
      "as he looked at them they began to whisper.\n",
      "They whispered, \"_Do you\r\n",
      "remember this?_\" \"_Do you remember that?_\" The Emperor remembered so\r\n",
      "much that he cried out loud, \"Oh, bring the great drum!\n",
      "Make music, so\r\n",
      "that I may not hear these dreadful whispers!\"\n",
      "But there was nobody there\r\n",
      "to bring the drum.\n",
      "Then the Emperor cried, \"You little gold nightingale, can you not sing\r\n",
      "something for me?\n",
      "I have given you gifts of gold and jewels, and kept\r\n",
      "you always by my side; will you not help me now?\"\n",
      "But there was nobody\r\n",
      "to wind the little gold nightingale up, and of course it could not sing.\n",
      "The Emperor's heart grew colder and colder where Death crouched upon it,\r\n",
      "and the dreadful whispers grew louder and louder, and the Emperor's life\r\n",
      "was almost gone.\n",
      "Suddenly, through the open window, there came a most\r\n",
      "lovely song.\n",
      "It was so sweet and so loud that the whispers died quite\r\n",
      "away.\n",
      "Presently the Emperor felt his heart grow warm, then he felt the\r\n",
      "blood flow through his limbs again; he listened to the song until the\r\n",
      "tears ran down his cheeks; he knew that it was the little real\r\n",
      "Nightingale who had flown away from him when the gold nightingale came.\n",
      "Death was listening to the song, too; and when it was done and the\r\n",
      "Emperor begged for more, Death, too, said, \"Please sing again, little\r\n",
      "Nightingale!\"\n",
      "\"Will you give me the Emperor's gold crown for a song?\"\n",
      "said the little\r\n",
      "Nightingale.\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Death; and the little Nightingale bought the Emperor's crown\r\n",
      "for a song.\n",
      "\"Oh, sing again, little Nightingale,\" begged Death.\n",
      "\"Will you give me the Emperor's sceptre for another song?\"\n",
      "said the\r\n",
      "little grey Nightingale.\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Death; and the little Nightingale bought the Emperor's\r\n",
      "sceptre for another song.\n",
      "Once more Death begged for a song, and this time the little Nightingale\r\n",
      "obtained the banner for her singing.\n",
      "Then she sang one more song, so\r\n",
      "sweet and so sad that it made Death think of his garden in the\r\n",
      "churchyard, where he always liked best to be.\n",
      "And he rose from the\r\n",
      "Emperor's heart and floated away through the window.\n",
      "When Death was gone, the Emperor said to the little Nightingale, \"Oh,\r\n",
      "dear little Nightingale, you have saved me from Death!\n",
      "Do not leave me\r\n",
      "again.\n",
      "Stay with me on this little gold perch, and sing to me always!\"\n",
      "\"No, dear Emperor,\" said the little Nightingale, \"I sing best when I am\r\n",
      "free; I cannot live in a palace.\n",
      "But every night when you are quite\r\n",
      "alone, I will come and sit in the window and sing to you, and tell you\r\n",
      "everything that goes on in your kingdom: I will tell you where the poor\r\n",
      "people are who ought to be helped, and where the wicked people are who\r\n",
      "ought to be punished.\n",
      "Only, dear Emperor, be sure that you never let\r\n",
      "anybody know that you have a little bird who tells you everything.\"\n",
      "After the little Nightingale had flown away, the Emperor felt so well\r\n",
      "and strong that he dressed himself in his royal robes and took his gold\r\n",
      "sceptre in his hand.\n",
      "And when the courtiers came in to see if he were\r\n",
      "dead, there stood the Emperor with his sword in one hand and his sceptre\r\n",
      "in the other, and said, \"Good-morning!\"\n",
      "MARGERY'S GARDEN\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was once a little girl named Margery, who had always lived in the\r\n",
      "city.\n",
      "The flat where her mother and father lived was at the top of a big\r\n",
      "building, and you couldn't see a great deal from the windows, except\r\n",
      "chimney-pots on other people's roofs.\n",
      "Margery did not know much about\r\n",
      "trees and flowers, but she loved them dearly; whenever it was a fine\r\n",
      "Sunday she used to go with her mother and father to the park and look at\r\n",
      "the lovely flower-beds.\n",
      "They seemed always to be finished, though, and\r\n",
      "Margery was always wishing she could see them grow.\n",
      "One spring, when Margery was nine, her father obtained a new situation\r\n",
      "and they removed to a little house with a nice big piece of ground a\r\n",
      "short distance outside the town where his new position was.\n",
      "Margery was\r\n",
      "delighted.\n",
      "And the very first thing she said, when her father told her\r\n",
      "about it, was, \"Oh, may I have a garden?\n",
      "_May_ I have a garden?\"\n",
      "Margery's mother was almost as eager for a garden as she was, and\r\n",
      "Margery's father said he expected to live on their vegetables all the\r\n",
      "rest of his life!\n",
      "So it was soon agreed that the garden should be the\r\n",
      "first thing attended to.\n",
      "Behind the cottage were apple trees, a plum tree, and two or three pear\r\n",
      "trees; then came a stretch of rough grass, and then a stone wall, with a\r\n",
      "gate leading into the fields.\n",
      "It was on the grass plot that the garden\r\n",
      "was to be.\n",
      "A big piece was to be used for wheat and peas and beans, and\r\n",
      "a little piece at the end was to be given to Margery.\n",
      "\"What shall we have in it?\"\n",
      "asked her mother.\n",
      "\"Flowers,\" said Margery, with shining eyes,--\"blue, and white, and\r\n",
      "yellow, and pink,--every kind of flower!\"\n",
      "\"Surely, flowers,\" said her mother, \"and shall we not have a little\r\n",
      "salad garden in the middle?\"\n",
      "\"What is a salad garden?\"\n",
      "Margery asked.\n",
      "\"It is a garden where you have all the things that make nice salad,\"\r\n",
      "said her mother, laughing, for Margery was fond of salads; \"you have\r\n",
      "lettuce, and endive, and mustard and cress, and parsley, and radishes,\r\n",
      "and beetroot, and young onions.\"\n",
      "\"Oh!\n",
      "how good it sounds!\"\n",
      "said Margery.\n",
      "\"I should love a salad garden.\"\n",
      "That very evening, Margery's father took pencil and paper, and drew out\r\n",
      "a plan for her garden; first, they talked it all over, then he drew what\r\n",
      "they decided on; it looked like the diagram on the next page.\n",
      "\"The outside strip is for flowers,\" said Margery's father, \"and next is\r\n",
      "a footpath, all the way round the beds; that is to let you get at the\r\n",
      "flowers to weed and to pick; there is a wider path through the middle,\r\n",
      "and the rest is for rows of salad vegetables.\"\n",
      "\"Papa, it is glorious!\"\n",
      "said Margery.\n",
      "Papa laughed.\n",
      "\"I hope you will still think it glorious when the weeding\r\n",
      "time comes,\" he said, \"for you know, you and mother have promised to\r\n",
      "take care of this garden, while I take care of the big one.\"\n",
      "\"I wouldn't _not_ take care of it for anything!\"\n",

      "After the ploughing and harrowing, the man drove off, and Margery's\r\n",
      "father said that he himself would do the rest of the work in the late\r\n",
      "afternoons, when he came home from business; they could not afford too\r\n",
      "much help, he said, and he had learned to take care of a garden when he\r\n",
      "was a boy.\n",
      "So Margery did not see any more done until the next day.\n",
      "But the next day there was hard work for Margery's father!\n",
      "Every bit of\r\n",
      "that ground had to be broken up still more with a spade, and then the\r\n",
      "clods which were full of grass-roots had to be taken on a fork and\r\n",
      "shaken, till the earth fell out; when the grass was thrown to one side.\n",
      "That would not have had to be done if the land had been ploughed in the\r\n",
      "autumn; the grass would have rotted in the ground, and would have made\r\n",
      "food for the plants.\n",
      "Now, Margery's father put the fertiliser on the\r\n",
      "top, and then raked it into the earth.\n",
      "At last, it was time to make the place for the seeds.\n",
      "Margery and her\r\n",
      "mother helped.\n",
      "Father tied one end of a cord to a little stake, and\r\n",
      "drove the stake in the ground at one end of the garden.\n",
      "Then he took the\r\n",
      "cord to the other end of the garden and pulled it tight, tied it to\r\n",
      "another stake, and drove that down.\n",
      "That made a straight line.\n",
      "Then he\r\n",
      "hoed a trench, a few inches deep, the whole length of the cord, and\r\n",
      "scattered fertiliser in it.\n",
      "Pretty soon the whole garden was lined with\r\n",
      "little trenches.\n",
      "\"Now for the seed,\" said father.\n",
      "Margery ran and brought the seed box.\n",
      "\"May I help?\"\n",
      "she asked.\n",
      "\"If you watch me sow one row, I think you can do the next,\" said her\r\n",
      "father.\n",
      "So Margery watched.\n",
      "Her father took a handful of peas, and, stooping,\r\n",
      "walked slowly along the line, letting the seed trickle through his\r\n",
      "fingers.\n",
      "It was pretty to watch; it made Margery think of a photograph\r\n",
      "her teacher had, a photograph of a famous picture called \"The Sower.\"\n",
      "Perhaps you have seen it.\n",
      "Putting in the seed was not so easy to do as to watch; sometimes Margery\r\n",
      "dropped in too much, and sometimes not enough; but her father was\r\n",
      "patient with her, and soon she did better.\n",
      "They planted peas, beans, spinach, carrots, and parsnips.\n",
      "And Margery's\r\n",
      "father made a row of holes, after that, for the tomato plants.\n",
      "He said\r\n",
      "those had to be transplanted; they could not be sown from seed.\n",
      "When the seeds were in the trenches they had to be covered up, and\r\n",
      "Margery really helped at that.\n",
      "It is fun to do it.\n",
      "You stand beside the\r\n",
      "little trench and walk backward, and as you walk you hoe the loose earth\r\n",
      "back over the seeds; the same earth that was hoed up you pull back\r\n",
      "again.\n",
      "Then you rake very gently over the surface, with the back of a\r\n",
      "rake, to even it all off.\n",
      "Margery liked it, because now the garden began\r\n",
      "to look _like_ a garden.\n",
      "But best of all was the work next day, when her own little particular\r\n",
      "garden was begun.\n",
      "Father Brown loved Margery and Margery's mother so\r\n",
      "much that he wanted their garden to be perfect, and that meant a great\r\n",
      "deal more work.\n",
      "He knew very well that the old grass would begin to come\r\n",
      "through again on such soil, and that it would make terribly hard\r\n",
      "weeding.\n",
      "He was not going to have any such thing for his two \"little\r\n",
      "girls,\" as he called them.\n",
      "So he gave that little garden particular\r\n",
      "attention.\n",
      "This is what he did.\n",
      "After he had thrown out all the turf, he shovelled clean earth on to the\r\n",
      "garden,--as much as three solid inches of it; not a bit of grass was in\r\n",
      "that.\n",
      "Then it was ready for raking and fertilising, and for the lines.\n",
      "The little footpaths were marked out by Father Brown's feet; Margery and\r\n",
      "her mother laughed well at his actions, for it looked like some kind of\r\n",
      "dance.\n",
      "Mr Brown had seen gardeners do it when he was a little boy, and\r\n",
      "he did it very nicely: he walked along the sides of the square, with one\r\n",
      "foot turned a little out, and the other straight, taking such tiny steps\r\n",
      "that his feet touched each other all the time.\n",
      "This tramped out a path\r\n",
      "just wide enough for a person to walk.\n",
      "The wider path was marked with lines and raked.\n",
      "Margery thought, of course, all the flowers would be put in as the\r\n",
      "vegetables were; but she found that it was not so.\n",
      "For some, her father\r\n",
      "poked little holes with his finger; for some, he made very shallow\r\n",
      "trenches; and some very small seeds were scattered lightly over the top\r\n",
      "of the ground.\n",
      "Margery and her mother had taken so much pains in thinking out the\r\n",
      "arrangement of the flowers, that perhaps you will like to hear just how\r\n",
      "they designed that garden.\n",
      "At the back were the sweet peas, which would\r\n",
      "grow tall, like a screen; on the two sides, for a kind of hedge, were\r\n",
      "yellow sunflowers; and along the front edge were the gay nasturtiums.\n",
      "Margery planned that, so that she could look into the garden from the\r\n",
      "front, but have it shut away from the vegetable patch by the tall\r\n",
      "flowers on the sides.\n",
      "The two front corners had canariensis in them.\n",
      "Canariensis is a pretty creeper with golden blossoms, very dainty and\r\n",
      "bright.\n",
      "And then, in little square patches all round the garden, were\r\n",
      "planted London pride, blue bachelor's buttons, yellow marigolds, tall\r\n",
      "larkspur, many-coloured asters, hollyhocks and stocks.\n",
      "All these lovely\r\n",
      "flowers used to grow in our grandmothers' gardens, and if you don't know\r\n",
      "what they look like, I hope you can find out next summer.\n",
      "Between the flowers and the middle path went the seeds for that\r\n",
      "wonderful salad garden; all the things Mrs Brown had named to Margery\r\n",
      "were there.\n",
      "Margery had never seen anything more wonderful than the\r\n",
      "little round lettuce-seeds.\n",
      "They were so tiny that it did not seem\r\n",
      "possible that green lettuce leaves could come from them.\n",
      "But they surely\r\n",
      "would.\n",
      "Mother and father and Margery were late to supper that evening.\n",
      "But they\r\n",
      "were all so happy that it did not matter.\n",
      "The last thing Margery\r\n",
      "thought of, as she went to sleep at night, was the dear, smooth little\r\n",
      "garden, with its funny footpath, and with the little sticks standing at\r\n",
      "the ends of the rows, labelled \"lettuce,\" \"beets,\" \"helianthus,\" and so\r\n",
      "on.\n",
      "\"I have a garden!\n",

      "This is another story about Margery's garden.\n",
      "The next morning after the garden was planted, Margery was up and out at\r\n",
      "six o'clock.\n",
      "She could not wait to look at her garden.\n",
      "To be sure, she\r\n",
      "knew that the seeds could not sprout in a single night, but she had a\r\n",
      "feeling that _something_ might happen at any moment.\n",
      "The garden was just\r\n",
      "as smooth and brown as the night before, and no little seedlings were in\r\n",
      "sight.\n",
      "But a very few mornings after that, when Margery went out, she saw a\r\n",
      "funny little crack opening up through the earth, the whole length of the\r\n",
      "patch.\n",
      "Quickly she knelt down on the footpath, to see.\n",
      "Yes!\n",
      "Tiny green\r\n",
      "leaves, a whole row of them, were pushing their way through the crust!\n",
      "Margery knew what she had put there: it was the radish-row; these must\r\n",
      "be radish leaves.\n",
      "She examined them very closely, so that she might\r\n",
      "know a radish next time.\n",
      "The little leaves, no bigger than half your\r\n",
      "little-finger nail, grew in twos,--two on each tiny stem; they were\r\n",
      "almost round.\n",
      "Margery flew back to her mother, to say that the first seeds were up.\n",
      "And her mother, nearly as excited as Margery, came to look at the little\r\n",
      "crack.\n",
      "Each day, after that, the row of radishes grew, till, in a week, it\r\n",
      "stood as high as your finger, green and sturdy.\n",
      "But about the third day,\r\n",
      "while Margery was stooping over the radishes, she saw something very,\r\n",
      "very small and green, peeping above ground, where the lettuce was\r\n",
      "planted.\n",
      "Could it be weeds?\n",
      "No, for on looking very closely she saw that\r\n",
      "the wee leaves faintly marked a regular row.\n",
      "They did not make a crack,\r\n",
      "like the radishes; they seemed too small and too far apart to push the\r\n",
      "earth up like that.\n",
      "Margery leaned down and looked with all her eyes at\r\n",
      "the baby plants.\n",
      "The tiny leaves grew two on a stem, and were almost\r\n",
      "round.\n",
      "The more she looked at them the more it seemed to Margery that\r\n",
      "they looked exactly as the radish looked when it first came up.\n",
      "\"Do you\r\n",
      "suppose,\" Margery said to herself, \"that lettuce and radish look alike\r\n",
      "while they are growing?\n",
      "They don't look alike when they are on the\r\n",
      "table!\"\n",
      "Day by day the lettuce grew, and soon the little round leaves were\r\n",
      "easier to examine; they certainly were very much like radish leaves.\n",
      "Then, one morning, while she was searching for signs of other seeds,\r\n",
      "Margery discovered the beets.\n",
      "In irregular patches on the row, hints of\r\n",
      "green were coming.\n",
      "The next day and the next they grew, until the beet\r\n",
      "leaves were big enough to see.\n",
      "Margery looked.\n",
      "Then she looked again.\n",
      "Then she wrinkled her forehead.\n",
      "\"Can we have made a mistake?\"\n",
      "she thought.\n",
      "\"Do you suppose we can have\r\n",
      "planted _all_ radishes?\"\n",
      "For those little beet leaves were almost round, and they grew two on a\r\n",
      "stem, precisely like the lettuce and the radish; except for the size,\r\n",
      "all three rows looked alike.\n",
      "It was too much for Margery.\n",
      "She ran to the house and found her father.\n",

      "happened.\n",
      "\"Papa,\" she said, all out of breath, \"do you think we could\r\n",

      "Father laughed.\n",
      "\"What makes you think such a thing?\"\n",
      "he asked.\n",
      "\"Papa,\" said Margery, \"the little leaves all look exactly alike!\n",
      "every\r\n",
      "plant has just two tiny leaves on it, and shaped the same; they are\r\n",
      "roundish, and grow out of the stem at the same place.\"\n",
      "Papa's eyes began to twinkle.\n",
      "\"Many of the dicotyledonous plants look\r\n",
      "alike at the beginning,\" he said, with a little drawl on the big word.\n",
      "That was to tease Margery, because she always wanted to know the big\r\n",
      "words she heard.\n",
      "\"What's 'dicotyledonous'?\"\n",
      "said Margery, carefully.\n",
      "\"Wait till I come home to-night, dear,\" said her father, \"and I'll tell\r\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "That evening Margery was waiting eagerly for him.\n",
      "When her father\r\n",
      "finished his supper they went together to the garden, and father\r\n",
      "examined the seedlings carefully.\n",
      "Then he pulled up a little radish\r\n",
      "plant and a tiny beet.\n",
      "\"These little leaves,\" he said, \"are not the real leaves of the plant;\r\n",
      "they are only little pockets to hold food for the plant to live on till\r\n",
      "it gets strong enough to push up into the air.\n",
      "As soon as the real\r\n",
      "leaves come out and begin to draw food from the air, these little\r\n",
      "substitutes wither up and fall off.\n",
      "These two lie folded up in the\r\n",
      "little seed from the beginning, and are full of plant food.\n",
      "They don't\r\n",
      "have to be very special in shape, you see, because they don't stay on\r\n",
      "the plant after it is grown up.\"\n",
      "\"Then every plant looks like this at first?\"\n",
      "said Margery.\n",
      "\"No, dear, not every one; plants are divided into two kinds: those which\r\n",
      "have two food leaves, like these plants, and those which have only one;\r\n",
      "these are called dicotyledonous, and the ones which have but one food\r\n",
      "leaf are monocotyledonous.\n",
      "Many of the dicotyledons look alike.\"\n",
      "\"I think that is interesting,\" said Margery.\n",
      "\"I always, supposed the plants were different from the minute they began\r\n",
      "to grow.\"\n",
      "\"Indeed, no,\" said father.\n",
      "\"Even some of the trees look like this when\r\n",
      "they first come through; you would not think a birch tree could look\r\n",
      "like a vegetable or a flower, would you?\n",
      "But it does, at first; it looks\r\n",
      "so much like these things that in the great nurseries, where trees are\r\n",
      "raised for forests and parks, the workmen have to be very carefully\r\n",
      "trained, or else they would pull up the trees when they are weeding.\n",
      "They have to be taught the difference between a birch tree and a weed.\"\n",
      "\"How funny!\"\n",
      "said Margery, dimpling.\n",
      "\"Yes, it sounds funny,\" said father; \"but, you see, the birch tree is\r\n",
      "dicotyledonous, and so are many weeds, and the dicotyledons look so much\r\n",
      "alike at first.\"\n",
      "\"I am glad to know that, father,\" said Margery, soberly.\n",

      "could talk with them to her heart's content; the Tortoise liked to talk.\n",
      "She always had something to say, and she liked to hear herself say it.\n",
      "After many years of this pleasant living, the pond became very low, in a\r\n",
      "dry season; and finally it dried up.\n",
      "The two Ducks saw that they could\r\n",
      "no longer live there, so they decided to fly to another region, where\r\n",
      "there was more water.\n",
      "They went to the Tortoise to bid her good-bye.\n",
      "\"Oh, don't leave me behind!\"\n",
      "begged the Tortoise.\n",
      "\"Take me with you; I\r\n",

      "take her.\n",
      "\"We have thought of a way which will be possible,\" they said,\r\n",
      "\"if only you can manage to keep still long enough.\n",
      "We will each take\r\n",
      "hold of one end of a stout stick, and do you take the middle in your\r\n",
      "mouth; then we will fly up in the air with you and carry you with us.\n",
      "But remember not to talk!\n",
      "If you open your mouth, you are lost.\"\n",
      "The Tortoise said she would not say a word; she would not so much as\r\n",
      "move her mouth; and she was very grateful.\n",
      "So the Ducks brought a strong\r\n",
      "little stick and took hold of the ends, while the Tortoise bit firmly on\r\n",
      "the middle.\n",
      "Then the two Ducks rose slowly in the air and flew away with\r\n",
      "their burden.\n",
      "When they were above the treetops, the Tortoise wanted to say, \"How high\r\n",
      "we are!\"\n",

      "When they passed the church\r\n",
      "steeple she wanted to say, \"What is that which shines?\"\n",
      "But she\r\n",
      "remembered, and held her peace.\n",

      "Robert of Sicily went to the services with the rest, and sat in the\r\n",
      "humblest place with the servants.\n",
      "Over and over again he heard the\r\n",

      "_He hath put down the mighty from their seat, and hath exalted them of\r\n",
      "low degree_.\n",
      "And at last, as he listened, his heart was softened.\n",
      "He,\r\n",
      "too, felt the strange blessed presence of a heavenly power.\n",
      "He thought\r\n",
      "of God, and of his own wickedness; he remembered how selfish he had\r\n",
      "been, and how little good he had done; he realised, that his power had\r\n",
      "not been from himself, at all.\n",
      "On Easter night, as he crept to his bed\r\n",
      "of straw, he wept, not because he was so wretched, but because he had\r\n",
      "not been a better king when power was his.\n",
      "At last all the festivities were over, and the King of Sicily went home\r\n",
      "to his own land again, with his people.\n",
      "Robert the jester came home too.\n",

      "The sound of their\r\n",
      "singing came softly in at the palace windows.\n",
      "In the great banquet room,\r\n",
      "the king sat, wearing his royal robes and his crown, while many subjects\r\n",
      "came to greet him.\n",
      "At last, he sent them all away, saying he wanted to\r\n",
      "be alone; but he commanded the jester to stay.\n",
      "And when they were alone\r\n",
      "together the king looked into Robert's eyes, as he had done before, and\r\n",
      "said, softly, \"Who art thou?\"\n",
      "Robert of Sicily bowed his head.\n",
      "\"Thou knowest best,\" he said, \"I only\r\n",
      "know that I have sinned.\"\n",
      "As he spoke, he heard the voices of the monks singing, _He hath put down\r\n",
      "the mighty from their seat_,--and his head sank lower.\n",
      "But suddenly the\r\n",
      "music seemed to change; a wonderful light shone all about.\n",
      "As Robert\r\n",
      "raised his eyes, he saw the face of the king smiling at him with a\r\n",
      "radiance like nothing on earth, and as he sank to his knees before the\r\n",
      "glory of that smile, a voice sounded with the music, like a melody\r\n",
      "throbbing on a single string,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am an angel, and thou art the king!\"\n",
      "Then Robert of Sicily was alone.\n",
      "His royal robes were upon him once\r\n",

      "once a very famous artist who lived in the little town of Duesseldorf.\n",
      "He\r\n",
      "did such fine work that the Elector, Prince Johann Wilhelm, ordered a\r\n",
      "portrait statue of himself, on horseback, to be done in bronze.\n",

      "The Elector\r\n",
      "came on the appointed day, and with him came his favourite courtiers\r\n",

      "It was very\r\n",
      "beautiful,--so beautiful that the prince exclaimed in surprise.\n",
      "He could\r\n",
      "not look enough, and presently he turned to the artist and shook hands\r\n",
      "with him, like an old friend.\n",
      "\"Herr Grupello,\" he said, \"you are a great\r\n",
      "artist, and this statue will make your fame even greater than it is; the\r\n",
      "portrait of me is perfect!\"\n",
      "When the courtiers heard this, and saw the friendly hand-shake, their\r\n",
      "jealousy of the artist was beyond bounds.\n",
      "Their one thought was, how\r\n",
      "could they safely do something to humiliate him.\n",
      "They dared not pick\r\n",

      "me to say that the statue of the horse is not quite so successful: the\r\n",

      "to do what I can with it?\"\n",
      "The Elector assented, and the artist ordered a temporary screen to be\r\n",
      "built around the statue, so that his assistants could work undisturbed.\n",
      "For several days the sound of hammering came steadily from behind the\r\n",
      "enclosure.\n",

      "Whenever he was crossed, or could not have his own way instantly,\r\n",
      "he flew into a passion.\n",
      "Finally, he wanted something that he really could not have.\n",
      "This time it\r\n",
      "was a most beautiful young girl, named Zelia; the prince saw her, and\r\n",
      "loved her so much that he wanted at once to make her his queen.\n",
      "To his\r\n",
      "great astonishment, she refused.\n",
      "\"Am I not pleasing to you?\"\n",
      "asked the prince in surprise.\n",
      "\"You are very handsome, very charming, prince,\" said Zelia; \"but you are\r\n",
      "not like the good king, your father; I fear you would make me very\r\n",
      "miserable if I were your queen.\"\n",
      "In a great rage, Prince Cherry ordered the young girl to be put in\r\n",
      "prison; and the key of her dungeon he kept.\n",
      "He told one of his friends,\r\n",
      "a wicked man who flattered him for his own purposes, about the thing,\r\n",
      "and asked his advice.\n",
      "\"Are you not king?\"\n",
      "said the bad friend.\n",
      "\"May you not do as you will?\n",
      "Keep the girl in a dungeon till she does as you command, and if she will\r\n",
      "not, sell her as a slave.\"\n",
      "\"But would it not be a disgrace for me to harm an innocent creature?\"\n",
      "said the prince.\n",
      "\"It would be a disgrace to you to have it said that one of your subjects\r\n",
      "dared disobey you!\"\n",
      "said the courtier.\n",
      "He had cleverly touched the prince's worst trait, his pride.\n",
      "Prince\r\n",
      "Cherry went at once to Zelia's dungeon, prepared to do this cruel thing.\n",
      "Zelia was gone.\n",
      "No one had the key save the prince himself; yet she was\r\n",
      "gone.\n",
      "The only person who could have dared to help her, thought the\r\n",
      "prince, was his old tutor, Suliman, the only man left who ever rebuked\r\n",
      "him for anything.\n",
      "In fury, he ordered Suliman to be put in fetters and\r\n",
      "brought before him.\n",
      "As his servants left him, to carry out the wicked order, there was a\r\n",
      "clash, as of thunder, in the room, and then a blinding light.\n",
      "Fairy\r\n",
      "Candide stood before him.\n",
      "Her beautiful face was stern, and her silver\r\n",
      "voice rang like a trumpet, as she said, \"Wicked and selfish prince, you\r\n",
      "have become baser than the beasts you hunt; you are furious as a lion,\r\n",
      "revengeful as a serpent, greedy as a wolf, and brutal as a bull; take,\r\n",
      "therefore, the shape of those beasts whom you resemble!\"\n",
      "With horror, the prince felt himself being transformed into a monster.\n",
      "He tried to rush upon the fairy and kill her, but she had vanished with\r\n",
      "her words.\n",
      "As he stood, her voice came from the air, saying, sadly,\r\n",
      "\"Learn to conquer your pride by being in submission to your own\r\n",
      "subjects.\"\n",
      "At the same moment, Prince Cherry felt himself being\r\n",
      "transported to a distant forest, where he was set down by a clear\r\n",
      "stream.\n",
      "In the water he saw his own terrible image; he had the head of a\r\n",
      "lion, with bull's horns, the feet of a wolf, and a tail like a serpent.\n",
      "And as he gazed in horror, the fairy's voice whispered, \"Your soul has\r\n",
      "become more ugly than your shape is; you yourself have deformed it.\"\n",
      "The poor beast rushed away from the sound of her words, but in a moment\r\n",
      "he stumbled into a trap, set by bear-catchers.\n",
      "When the trappers found\r\n",
      "him they were delighted to have caught a curiosity, and they immediately\r\n",
      "dragged him to the palace courtyard.\n",
      "There he heard the whole court\r\n",
      "buzzing with gossip.\n",
      "Prince Cherry had been struck by lightning and\r\n",
      "killed, was the news, and the five favourite courtiers had struggled to\r\n",
      "make themselves rulers, but the people had refused them, and offered the\r\n",
      "crown to Suliman, the good old tutor.\n",
      "Even as he heard this, the prince saw Suliman on the steps of the\r\n",
      "palace, speaking to the people.\n",
      "\"I will take the crown to keep in\r\n",
      "trust,\" he said.\n",
      "\"Perhaps the prince is not dead.\"\n",
      "\"He was a bad king; we do not want him back,\" said the people.\n",
      "\"I know his heart,\" said Suliman, \"it is not all bad; it is tainted, but\r\n",
      "not corrupt; perhaps he will repent and come back to us a good king.\"\n",
      "When the beast heard this, it touched him so much that he stopped\r\n",
      "tearing at his chains, and became gentle.\n",
      "He let his keepers lead him\r\n",
      "away to the royal menagerie without hurting them.\n",
      "Life was very terrible to the prince, now, but he began to see that he\r\n",
      "had brought all his sorrow on himself, and he tried to bear it\r\n",
      "patiently.\n",
      "The worst to bear was the cruelty of the keeper.\n",
      "At last, one\r\n",
      "night, this keeper was in great danger; a tiger got loose, and attacked\r\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\"Good enough!\n",
      "Let him die!\"\n",
      "thought Prince Cherry.\n",
      "But when he saw\r\n",
      "how helpless the keeper was, he repented, and sprang to help.\n",
      "He killed\r\n",
      "the tiger and saved the keeper's life.\n",
      "As he crouched at the keeper's feet, a voice said, \"Good actions never\r\n",
      "go unrewarded!\"\n",
      "And the terrible monster was changed into a pretty\r\n",
      "little white dog.\n",
      "The keeper carried the beautiful little dog to the court and told the\r\n",
      "story, and from then on, Cherry was carefully treated, and had the best\r\n",
      "of everything.\n",
      "But in order to keep the little dog from growing, the\r\n",
      "queen ordered that he should be fed very little, and that was pretty\r\n",
      "hard for the poor prince.\n",
      "He was often half starved, although so much\r\n",
      "petted.\n",
      "One day he had carried his crust of bread to a retired spot in the\r\n",
      "palace woods, where he loved to be, when he saw a poor old woman hunting\r\n",
      "for roots, and seeming almost starved.\n",
      "\"Poor thing,\" he thought, \"she is even more hungry than I\"; and he ran\r\n",
      "up and dropped the crust at her feet.\n",
      "The woman ate it, and seemed greatly refreshed.\n",
      "Cherry was glad of that, and he was running happily back to his kennel\r\n",
      "when he heard cries of distress, and suddenly he saw some rough men\r\n",
      "dragging along a young girl, who was weeping and crying for help.\n",
      "What\r\n",
      "was his horror to see that the young girl was Zelia!\n",
      "Oh, how he wished\r\n",
      "he were the monster once more, so that he could kill the men and rescue\r\n",
      "her!\n",
      "But he could do nothing except bark, and bite at the heels of the\r\n",
      "wicked men.\n",
      "That did not stop them; they drove him off, with blows, and\r\n",
      "carried Zelia into a palace in the wood.\n",
      "Poor Cherry crouched by the steps, and watched.\n",
      "His heart was full of\r\n",
      "pity and rage.\n",
      "But suddenly he thought, \"I was as bad as these men; I\r\n",
      "myself put Zelia in prison, and would have treated her worse still, if I\r\n",
      "had not been prevented.\"\n",
      "The thought made him so sorry and ashamed that\r\n",
      "he repented bitterly the evil he had done.\n",
      "Presently a window opened, and Cherry saw Zelia lean out and throw down\r\n",
      "a piece of meat.\n",
      "He seized it and was just going to devour it, when the\r\n",
      "old woman to whom he had given his crust snatched it away and took him\r\n",
      "in her arms.\n",
      "\"No, you shall not eat it, you poor little thing,\" she\r\n",
      "said, \"for every bit of food in that house is poisoned.\"\n",
      "At the same moment, a voice said, \"Good actions never go unrewarded!\"\n",
      "And instantly Prince Cherry was transformed into a little white dove.\n",
      "With great joy, he flew to the open palace window to seek out his Zelia,\r\n",
      "to try to help her.\n",
      "But though he hunted in every room, no Zelia was to\r\n",
      "be found.\n",
      "He had to fly away, without seeing her.\n",
      "He wanted more than\r\n",
      "anything else to find her, and stay near her, so he flew out into the\r\n",
      "world, to seek her.\n",
      "He sought her in many lands, until one day, in a far eastern country, he\r\n",
      "found her sitting in a tent, by the side of an old, white-haired hermit.\n",
      "Cherry was wild with delight.\n",
      "He flew to her shoulder, caressed her hair\r\n",
      "with his beak, and cooed in her ear.\n",
      "\"You dear, lovely little thing!\"\n",
      "said Zelia.\n",
      "\"Will you stay with me?\n",
      "If\r\n",
      "you will, I will love you always.\"\n",
      "\"Ah, Zelia, see what you have done!\"\n",
      "laughed the hermit.\n",
      "At that\r\n",
      "instant, the white dove vanished, and Prince Cherry stood there, as\r\n",
      "handsome and charming as ever, and with a look of kindness and modesty\r\n",
      "in his eyes which had never been there before.\n",
      "At the same time, the\r\n",
      "hermit stood up, his flowing hair changed to shining gold, and his face\r\n",
      "became a lovely woman's face; it was the Fairy Candide.\n",
      "\"Zelia has\r\n",
      "broken your spell,\" she said to the prince, \"as I meant she should, when\r\n",
      "you were worthy of her love.\"\n",
      "Zelia and Prince Cherry fell at the fairy's feet.\n",
      "But with a beautiful\r\n",
      "smile she bade them come to their kingdom.\n",
      "In a trice, they were\r\n",
      "transported to the prince's palace, where King Suliman greeted them with\r\n",
      "tears of joy.\n",
      "He gave back the throne with all his heart, and King\r\n",
      "Cherry ruled again, with Zelia for his queen.\n",
      "He wore the little gold ring all the rest of his life, but never once\r\n",
      "did it have to prick him hard enough to make his finger bleed.\n",
      "THE GOLD IN THE ORCHARD\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was once a farmer who had a fine olive orchard.\n",
      "He was very\r\n",
      "industrious, and the farm always prospered under his care.\n",
      "But he knew\r\n",
      "that his three sons despised the farm work, and were eager to make\r\n",
      "wealth fast, through adventure.\n",
      "When the farmer was old, and felt that his time had come to die, he\r\n",
      "called the three sons to him and said, \"My sons, there is a pot of gold\r\n",
      "hidden in the olive orchard.\n",
      "Dig for it, if you wish it.\"\n",
      "The sons tried to get him to tell them in what part of the orchard the\r\n",
      "gold was hidden; but he would tell them nothing more.\n",
      "After the farmer was dead, the sons went to work to find the pot of\r\n",
      "gold; since they did not know where the hiding-place was, they agreed to\r\n",
      "begin in a line, at one end of the orchard, and to dig until one of them\r\n",
      "should find the money.\n",
      "They dug until they had turned up the soil from one end of the orchard\r\n",
      "to the other, round the tree-roots and between them.\n",
      "But no pot of gold\r\n",
      "was to be found.\n",
      "It seemed as if some one must have stolen it, or as if\r\n",
      "the farmer had been wandering in his wits.\n",
      "The three sons were bitterly\r\n",
      "disappointed to have all their work for nothing.\n",
      "The next olive season, the olive trees in the orchard bore more fruit\r\n",
      "than they had ever given before; the fine cultivating they had had from\r\n",
      "the digging brought so much fruit, and of so fine a quality, that when\r\n",
      "it was sold it gave the sons a whole pot of gold!\n",
      "And when they saw how much money had come from the orchard, they\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If you ever go to the beautiful city of New Orleans, somebody will be\r\n",
      "sure to take you down into the old business part of the city, where\r\n",
      "there are banks and shops and hotels, and show you a statue which stands\r\n",
      "in a little square there.\n",
      "It is the statue of a woman, sitting in a low\r\n",
      "chair, with her arms around a child, who leans against her.\n",
      "The woman is\r\n",
      "not at all pretty: she wears thick, common shoes, a plain dress, with a\r\n",
      "little shawl, and a sun-bonnet; she is stout and short, and her face is\r\n",
      "a square-chinned Irish face; but her eyes look at you like your\r\n",
      "mother's.\n",
      "Now there is something very surprising about this statue: it was the\r\n",
      "first one that was ever made in America in honour of a woman.\n",
      "Even in\r\n",
      "Europe there are not many monuments to women, and most of the few are to\r\n",
      "great queens or princesses, very beautiful and very richly dressed.\n",
      "You\r\n",
      "see, this statue in New Orleans is not quite like anything else.\n",
      "It is the statue of a woman named Margaret.\n",
      "Her whole name was Margaret\r\n",
      "Haughery, but no one in New Orleans remembers her by it, any more than\r\n",
      "you think of your dearest sister by her full name; she is just Margaret.\n",
      "This is her story, and it tells why people made a monument for her.\n",
      "When Margaret was a tiny baby, her father and mother died, and she was\r\n",
      "adopted by two young people as poor and as kind as her own parents.\n",
      "She\r\n",
      "lived with them until she grew up.\n",
      "Then she married, and had a little\r\n",
      "baby of her own.\n",
      "But very soon her husband died, and then the baby died,\r\n",
      "too, and Margaret was all alone in the world.\n",
      "She was poor, but she was\r\n",
      "strong, and knew how to work.\n",
      "All day, from morning until evening, she ironed clothes in a laundry.\n",
      "And every day, as she worked by the window, she saw the little\r\n",
      "motherless children from the orphan asylum, near by, working and\r\n",
      "playing about.\n",
      "After a while, there came a great sickness upon the city,\r\n",
      "and so many mothers and fathers died that there were more orphans than\r\n",
      "the asylum could possibly take care of.\n",
      "They needed a good friend, now.\n",
      "You would hardly think, would you, that a poor woman who worked in a\r\n",
      "laundry could be much of a friend to them?\n",
      "But Margaret was.\n",
      "She went\r\n",
      "straight to the kind Sisters who had the asylum and told them she was\r\n",
      "going to give them part of her wages and was going to work for them,\r\n",
      "besides.\n",
      "Pretty soon she had worked so hard that she had some money\r\n",
      "saved from her wages.\n",
      "With this, she bought two cows and a little\r\n",
      "delivery cart.\n",
      "Then she carried her milk to her customers in the little\r\n",
      "cart every morning; and as she went, she begged the pieces of food left\r\n",
      "over from the hotels and rich houses, and brought it back in the cart to\r\n",
      "the hungry children in the asylum.\n",
      "In the very hardest times that was\r\n",
      "often all the food the poor children had.\n",
      "A part of the money Margaret earned went every week to the asylum, and\r\n",
      "after a few years that was made very much larger and better.\n",
      "Margaret\r\n",
      "was so careful and so good at business that, in spite of her giving, she\r\n",
      "bought more cows and earned more money.\n",
      "With this, she built a home for\r\n",
      "orphan babies; she called it her baby house.\n",
      "After a time, Margaret had a chance to get a bakery, and then she became\r\n",
      "a bread-woman instead of a milk-woman.\n",
      "She carried the bread just as she\r\n",
      "had carried the milk, in her cart.\n",
      "And still she kept giving money to\r\n",
      "the asylum.\n",
      "Then the great war came, the Civil War.\n",
      "In all the trouble\r\n",
      "and sickness and fear of that time, Margaret drove her cart of bread;\r\n",
      "and somehow she had always enough to give the starving soldiers, and for\r\n",
      "her babies, beside what she sold.\n",
      "And despite all this, she earned\r\n",
      "enough so that when the war was over she built a big steam factory for\r\n",
      "her bread.\n",
      "By this time everybody in the city knew her.\n",
      "The children all\r\n",
      "over the city loved her; the business men were proud of her; the poor\r\n",
      "people all came to her for advice.\n",
      "She used to sit at the open door of\r\n",
      "her office, in a calico gown and a little shawl, and give a good word to\r\n",
      "everybody, rich or poor.\n",
      "Then, by and by, one day, Margaret died.\n",
      "And when it was time to read\r\n",
      "her will, the people found that, with all her giving, she had still\r\n",
      "saved a great deal of money, and that she had left every penny of it to\r\n",
      "the different orphan asylums of the city,--each one of them was given\r\n",
      "something.\n",
      "Whether they were for white children or black, for Jews,\r\n",
      "Catholics, or Protestants, made no difference; for Margaret always said,\r\n",
      "\"They are all orphans alike.\"\n",
      "And just think, dears, that splendid,\r\n",
      "wise will was signed with a cross instead of a name, for Margaret had\r\n",
      "never learned to read or write!\n",
      "When the people of New Orleans knew that Margaret was dead, they said,\r\n",
      "\"She was a mother to the motherless; she was a friend to those who had\r\n",
      "no friends; she had wisdom greater than schools can teach; we will not\r\n",
      "let her memory go from us.\"\n",
      "So they made a statue of her, just as she\r\n",
      "used to look, sitting in her own office door, or driving in her own\r\n",
      "little cart.\n",
      "And there it stands to-day, in memory of the great love and\r\n",
      "the great power of plain Margaret Haughery, of New Orleans.\n",
      "THE DAGDA'S HARP\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "You know, dears, in the old countries there are many fine stories about\r\n",
      "things which happened so very long ago that nobody knows exactly how\r\n",
      "much of them is true.\n",
      "Ireland is like that.\n",
      "It is so old that even as\r\n",
      "long ago as four thousand years it had people who dug in the mines, and\r\n",
      "knew how to weave cloth and to make beautiful ornaments out of gold, and\r\n",
      "who could fight and make laws; but we do not know just where they came\r\n",
      "from, nor exactly how they lived.\n",
      "These people left us some splendid\r\n",
      "stories about their kings, their fights, and their beautiful women; but\r\n",
      "it all happened such a long time ago that the stories are mixtures of\r\n",
      "things that really happened and what people said about them, and we\r\n",
      "don't know just which is which.\n",
      "The stories are called _legends_.\n",
      "One of\r\n",
      "the prettiest legends is the story I am going to tell you about the\r\n",
      "Dagda's harp.\n",
      "It is said that there were two quite different kinds of people in\r\n",
      "Ireland: one set of people with long dark hair and dark eyes, called\r\n",
      "Fomorians--they carried long slender spears made of golden bronze when\r\n",
      "they fought--and another race of people who were golden-haired and\r\n",
      "blue-eyed, and who carried short, blunt, heavy spears of dull metal.\n",
      "The golden-haired people had a great chieftain who was also a kind of\r\n",
      "high priest, who was called the Dagda.\n",
      "And this Dagda had a wonderful\r\n",
      "magic harp.\n",
      "The harp was beautiful to look upon, mighty in size, made of\r\n",
      "rare wood, and ornamented with gold and jewels; and it had wonderful\r\n",
      "music in its strings, which only the Dagda could call out.\n",
      "When the men\r\n",
      "were going out to battle, the Dagda would set up his magic harp and\r\n",
      "sweep his hand across the strings, and a war song would ring out which\r\n",
      "would make every warrior buckle on his armour, brace his knees, and\r\n",

      "Once more the Dagda touched his harp, but very, very softly.\n",
      "And now a\r\n",

      "The tailor said, \"I will certainly do that, but you must give\r\n",

      "all poured into the skin, and the giant thought he had drunk it.\n",
      "The\r\n",
      "giant drank another gallon then, and the tailor let another gallon down\r\n",
      "into the skin, but the giant thought he was drinking it.\n",
      "\"I'll do a thing now that you will not dare to do,\" said the tailor.\n",
      "\"You will not,\" said the giant.\n",
      "\"What is it you would do?\"\n",
      "\"Make a hole and let out the broth again,\" said the tailor.\n",
      "\"Do it yourself first,\" said the giant.\n",

      "That is the way the tailor killed the\r\n",
      "third giant.\n",

      "they asked the sea-king if he had not got salt enough.\n",
      "But the sea-king was hard of heart, like Frode, and he roughly bade them\r\n",
      "go on grinding.\n",
      "And the maidens did so, and worked to such effect that\r\n",
      "within a short time the millstones had ground out so much salt that the\r\n",
      "weight of it began to sink the ship.\n",
      "Down, down it sank, ship and giants\r\n",

      "One lovely summer morning, just as the sun rose, two travellers started\r\n",
      "on a journey.\n",
      "They were both strong young men, but one was a lazy fellow\r\n",
      "and the other was a worker.\n",
      "As the first sunbeams came over the hills, they shone on a great castle\r\n",
      "standing on the heights, as far away as the eye could see.\n",
      "It was a\r\n",
      "wonderful and beautiful castle, all glistening towers that gleamed like\r\n",
      "marble, and glancing windows that shone like crystal.\n",
      "The two young men\r\n",
      "looked at it eagerly, and longed to go nearer.\n",
      "Suddenly, out of the distance, something like a great butterfly, of\r\n",
      "white and gold, swept toward them.\n",
      "And when it came nearer, they saw\r\n",
      "that it was a most beautiful lady, robed in floating garments as fine as\r\n",
      "cobwebs and wearing on her head a crown so bright that no one could tell\r\n",
      "whether it was of diamonds or of dew.\n",
      "She stood, light as air, on a\r\n",
      "great, shining, golden ball, which rolled along with her, swifter than\r\n",
      "the wind.\n",
      "As she passed the travellers, she turned her face to them and\r\n",
      "smiled.\n",
      "\"Follow me!\"\n",
      "she said.\n",
      "The lazy man sat down in the grass with a discontented sigh.\n",
      "\"She has\r\n",
      "an easy time of it!\"\n",
      "he said.\n",

      "her floating robe in his grasp.\n",
      "\"Who are you, and whither are you\r\n",
      "going?\"\n",
      "he asked.\n",
      "\"I am the Fairy of Fortune,\" the beautiful lady said, \"and that is my\r\n",
      "castle.\n",
      "You may reach it to-day, if you will; there is time, if you\r\n",
      "waste none.\n",
      "If you reach it before the last stroke of midnight, I will\r\n",
      "receive you there, and will be your friend.\n",
      "But if you come one second\r\n",
      "after midnight, it will be too late.\"\n",
      "When she had said this, her robe slipped from the traveller's hand and\r\n",
      "she was gone.\n",
      "The industrious man hurried back to his friend, and told him what the\r\n",
      "fairy had said.\n",
      "\"The idea!\"\n",
      "said the lazy, man, and he laughed; \"of course, if we had a\r\n",
      "horse there would be some chance, but _walk_ all that way?\n",
      "No, thank\r\n",
      "you!\"\n",
      "\"Then good-bye,\" said his friend, \"I am off.\"\n",
      "And he set out, down the\r\n",
      "road toward the shining castle, with a good steady stride, his eyes\r\n",
      "straight ahead.\n",
      "The lazy man lay down in the soft grass, and looked rather wistfully at\r\n",
      "the far-away towers.\n",
      "\"If only I had a good horse!\"\n",
      "he sighed.\n",
      "Just at that moment he felt something warm nosing about at his shoulder,\r\n",
      "and heard a little whinny.\n",
      "He turned round, and there stood a little\r\n",
      "horse!\n",
      "It was a dainty creature, gentle-looking, and finely built, and\r\n",
      "it was saddled and bridled.\n",
      "\"Hello!\"\n",
      "said the lazy man.\n",
      "\"Luck often comes when one isn't looking for\r\n",
      "it!\"\n",
      "And in an instant he had leaped on the horse, and headed him for\r\n",
      "the castle of fortune.\n",
      "The little horse started at a fine pace, and in a\r\n",
      "very few minutes they overtook the other traveller, plodding along on\r\n",
      "foot.\n",
      "\"How do you like shank's pony?\"\n",
      "laughed the lazy man, as he passed his\r\n",
      "friend.\n",
      "The industrious man only nodded, and kept on with his steady stride,\r\n",
      "eyes straight ahead.\n",
      "The horse kept his good pace, and by noon the towers of the castle stood\r\n",
      "out against the sky, much nearer and more beautiful.\n",
      "Exactly at noon,\r\n",
      "the horse turned aside from the road, into a shady grove on a hill, and\r\n",
      "stopped.\n",
      "\"Wise beast,\" said his rider: \"'haste makes waste,' and all things are\r\n",
      "better in moderation.\n",
      "I'll follow your example, and eat and rest a bit.\"\n",
      "He dismounted and sat down in the cool moss, with his back against a\r\n",
      "tree.\n",
      "He had a lunch in his traveller's pouch, and he ate it\r\n",
      "comfortably.\n",
      "Then he felt drowsy from the heat and the early ride, so he\r\n",
      "pulled his hat over his eyes, and settled himself for a nap.\n",
      "\"It will go\r\n",
      "all the better for a little rest,\" he said.\n",
      "That _was_ a sleep!\n",
      "He slept like the seven sleepers, and he dreamed the\r\n",
      "most beautiful things you could imagine.\n",
      "At last, he dreamed that he had\r\n",
      "entered the castle of fortune and was being received with great\r\n",
      "festivities.\n",
      "Everything he wanted was brought to him, and music played\r\n",
      "while fireworks were set off in his honour.\n",
      "The music was so loud that\r\n",
      "he awoke.\n",
      "He sat up, rubbing his eyes, and behold, the fireworks were\r\n",
      "the very last rays of the setting sun, and the music was the voice of\r\n",
      "the other traveller, passing the grove on foot!\n",
      "\"Time to be off,\" said the lazy man, and looked about him for the pretty\r\n",
      "horse.\n",
      "No horse was to be found.\n",
      "The only living thing near was an old,\r\n",
      "bony, grey donkey.\n",
      "The man called, and whistled, and looked, but no\r\n",
      "little horse appeared.\n",
      "After a long while he gave it up, and, since\r\n",
      "there was nothing better to do, he mounted the old grey donkey and set\r\n",
      "out again.\n",
      "The donkey was slow, and he was hard to ride, but he was better than\r\n",
      "nothing; and gradually the lazy man saw the towers of the castle draw\r\n",
      "nearer.\n",
      "Now it began to grow dark; in the castle windows the lights began to\r\n",
      "show.\n",
      "Then came trouble!\n",
      "Slower, and slower, went the grey donkey;\r\n",
      "slower, and slower, till, in the very middle of a pitch-black wood, he\r\n",
      "stopped and stood still.\n",
      "Not a step would he budge for all the coaxing\r\n",
      "and scolding and beating his rider could give.\n",
      "At last the rider kicked\r\n",
      "him, as well as beat him, and at that the donkey felt that he had had\r\n",
      "enough.\n",
      "Up went his hind heels, and down went his head, and over it went\r\n",
      "the lazy man on to the stony ground.\n",
      "There he lay groaning for many minutes, for it was not a soft place, I\r\n",
      "can assure you.\n",
      "How he wished he were in a soft, warm bed, with his\r\n",
      "aching bones comfortable in blankets!\n",
      "The very thought of it made him\r\n",
      "remember the Castle of Fortune, for he knew there must be fine beds\r\n",
      "there.\n",
      "To get to those beds he was even willing to bestir his poor\r\n",
      "limbs, so he sat up and felt about him for the donkey.\n",
      "No donkey was to be found.\n",
      "The lazy man crept round and round the spot where he had fallen,\r\n",
      "scratched his hands on the stumps, tore his face in the briers, and\r\n",
      "bumped his knees on the stones.\n",
      "But no donkey was there.\n",
      "He would have\r\n",
      "laid down to sleep again, but he could hear now the howls of hungry\r\n",
      "wolves in the woods; that it did not sound pleasant.\n",
      "Finally, his hand\r\n",
      "struck against something that felt like a saddle.\n",
      "He grasped it,\r\n",
      "thankfully, and started to mount his donkey.\n",
      "The beast he took hold of seemed very small, and, as he mounted, he felt\r\n",
      "that its sides were moist and slimy.\n",
      "It gave him a shudder, and he\r\n",
      "hesitated; but at that moment he heard a distant clock strike.\n",
      "It was\r\n",
      "striking eleven!\n",
      "There was still time to reach the castle of fortune,\r\n",
      "but no more than enough; so he mounted his new steed and rode on once\r\n",
      "more.\n",
      "The animal was easier to sit on than the donkey, and the saddle\r\n",
      "seemed remarkably high behind; it was good to lean against.\n",
      "But even the\r\n",
      "donkey was not so slow as this; the new steed was slower than he.\n",
      "After\r\n",
      "a while, however, he pushed his way out of the woods into the open, and\r\n",
      "there stood the castle, only a little way ahead!\n",
      "All its windows were\r\n",
      "ablaze with lights.\n",
      "A ray from them fell on the lazy man's beast, and he\r\n",
      "saw what he was riding: it was a gigantic snail!\n",
      "a snail as large as a\r\n",
      "calf!\n",
      "A cold shudder ran over the lazy man's body, and he would have got off\r\n",
      "his horrid animal then and there, but just then the clock struck once\r\n",
      "more.\n",
      "It was the first of the long, slow strokes that mark midnight!\n",
      "The\r\n",
      "man grew frantic when he heard it.\n",
      "He drove his heels into the snail's\r\n",
      "sides, to make him hurry.\n",
      "Instantly, the snail drew in his head, curled\r\n",
      "up in his shell, and left the lazy man sitting in a heap on the ground!\n",
      "The clock struck twice.\n",
      "If the man had run for it, he could still have\r\n",
      "reached the castle, but, instead, he sat still and shouted for a horse.\n",
      "\"A beast, a beast!\"\n",
      "he wailed, \"any kind of a beast that will take me to\r\n",
      "the castle!\"\n",
      "The clock struck three times.\n",
      "And as it struck the third note, something\r\n",
      "came rustling and rattling out of the darkness, something that sounded\r\n",
      "like a horse with harness.\n",
      "The lazy man jumped on its back, a very\r\n",
      "queer, low back.\n",
      "As he mounted, he saw the doors of the castle open, and\r\n",
      "saw his friend standing on the threshold, waving his cap and beckoning\r\n",
      "to him.\n",
      "The clock struck four times, and the new steed began to stir; as it\r\n",
      "struck five, he moved a pace forward; as it struck six, he stopped; as\r\n",
      "it struck seven, he turned himself about; as it struck eight, he began\r\n",
      "to move backward, away from the castle!\n",
      "The lazy man shouted, and beat him, but the beast went slowly backward.\n",
      "And the clock struck nine.\n",
      "The man tried to slide off, then, but from\r\n",
      "all sides of his strange animal great arms came reaching up and held him\r\n",
      "fast.\n",
      "And in the next ray of moonlight that broke the dark clouds, he\r\n",
      "saw that he was mounted on a monster crab!\n",
      "One by one, the lights went out, in the castle windows.\n",
      "The clock struck\r\n",
      "ten.\n",
      "Backward went the crab.\n",
      "Eleven!\n",
      "Still the crab went backward.\n",
      "The\r\n",
      "clock struck twelve!\n",
      "Then the great doors shut with a clang, and the\r\n",
      "castle of fortune was closed for ever to the lazy man.\n",
      "What became of him and his crab no one knows to this day, and no one\r\n",
      "cares.\n",
      "But the industrious man was received by the Fairy of Fortune, and\r\n",
      "made happy in the castle as long as he wanted to stay.\n",
      "And ever\r\n",
      "afterward she was his friend, helping him not only to happiness for\r\n",
      "himself, but also showing him how to help others, wherever he went.\n",
      "DAVID AND GOLIATH\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A long time ago, there was a boy named David, who lived in a country in\r\n",
      "the Far East.\n",
      "He was good to look upon, for he had fair hair and a ruddy\r\n",
      "skin; and he was very strong and brave and modest.\n",
      "He was shepherd-boy\r\n",
      "for his father, and all day--often all night--he was out in the fields,\r\n",
      "far from home, watching over the sheep.\n",
      "He had to guard them from wild\r\n",
      "animals, and lead them to the right pastures, and care for them.\n",
      "By and by, war broke out between the people of David's country and a\r\n",
      "people that lived near at hand; these men were called Philistines, and\r\n",
      "the people of David's country were named Israelites.\n",
      "All the strong men\r\n",
      "of Israel went up to the battle, to fight for their king.\n",
      "David's three\r\n",
      "older brothers went, but he was only a boy, so he was left behind to\r\n",
      "care for the sheep.\n",
      "After the brothers had been gone some time, David's father longed very\r\n",
      "much to hear from them, and to know if they were safe; so he sent for\r\n",
      "David, from the fields, and said to him, \"Take now for thy brothers an\r\n",
      "ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp,\r\n",
      "where thy brothers are; and carry these ten cheeses to the captain of\r\n",
      "their thousand, and see how thy brothers fare, and bring me word again.\"\n",
      "(An ephah is about three pecks.)\n",
      "David rose early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and\r\n",
      "took the corn and the loaves and the cheeses, as his father had\r\n",
      "commanded him, and went to the camp of the Israelites.\n",
      "The camp stood on a mountain on the one side, and the Philistines stood\r\n",
      "on a mountain on the other side; and there was a valley between.\n",
      "David\r\n",
      "came to the place where the Israelites were, just as the host was going\r\n",
      "forth to the fight, shouting for the battle.\n",
      "So he left his gifts in the\r\n",
      "hands of the keeper of the baggage, and ran into the army, amongst the\r\n",
      "soldiers, to find his brothers.\n",
      "When he found them, he saluted them and\r\n",
      "began to talk with them.\n",
      "But while he was asking them the questions his father had commanded,\r\n",
      "there arose a great shouting and tumult among the Israelites, and men\r\n",
      "came running back from the front line of battle; everything became\r\n",
      "confusion.\n",
      "David looked to see what the trouble was, and he saw a\r\n",
      "strange sight: down the slope of the opposite mountain came striding a\r\n",
      "Philistine warrior, calling out something in a taunting voice; he was a\r\n",
      "gigantic man, the largest David had ever seen, and he was covered with\r\n",
      "armour, that shone in the sun: he had a helmet of brass upon his head,\r\n",
      "and he was armed with a coat of mail, and he had greaves of brass upon\r\n",
      "his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders; his spear was so\r\n",
      "tremendous that the staff of it was like a weaver's beam, and his shield\r\n",
      "so great that a man went before him, to carry it.\n",
      "\"Who is that?\"\n",
      "asked David.\n",
      "\"It is Goliath, of Gath, champion of the Philistines,\" said the soldiers\r\n",
      "about.\n",
      "\"Every day, for forty days, he has come forth, so, and challenged\r\n",
      "us to send a man against him, in single combat; and since no one dares\r\n",
      "to go out against him alone, the armies cannot fight.\"\n",
      "(That was one of\r\n",
      "the laws of warfare in those times.)\n",
      "\"What!\"\n",
      "said David, \"does none dare go out against him?\"\n",
      "As he spoke, the giant stood still, on the hillside opposite the host\r\n",
      "of Israel, and shouted his challenge, scornfully.\n",
      "He said, \"Why are ye\r\n",
      "come out to set your battle in array?\n",
      "Am I not a Philistine, and ye\r\n",
      "servants of Saul?\n",
      "Choose you a man, and let him come down to me.\n",
      "If he\r\n",
      "be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants;\r\n",
      "but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our\r\n",
      "servants, and serve us.\n",
      "I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a\r\n",
      "man, that we may fight together!\"\n",
      "When King Saul heard these words, he was dismayed, and all the men of\r\n",
      "Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were sore afraid.\n",
      "David\r\n",
      "heard them talking among themselves, whispering and murmuring.\n",
      "They were\r\n",
      "saying, \"Have ye seen this man that is come up?\n",
      "Surely if anyone killeth\r\n",
      "him that man will the king make rich; perhaps he will give him his\r\n",
      "daughter in marriage, and make his family free in Israel!\"\n",
      "David heard this, and he asked the men if it were so.\n",
      "It was surely so,\r\n",
      "they said.\n",
      "\"But,\" said David, \"who is this Philistine, that he should defy the\r\n",
      "armies of the living God?\"\n",
      "And he was stirred with anger.\n",
      "Very soon, some of the officers told the king about the youth who was\r\n",
      "asking so many questions, and who said that it was shame upon Israel\r\n",
      "that a mere Philistine should defy the armies of the living God.\n",
      "Immediately Saul sent for him.\n",
      "When David came before Saul, he said to\r\n",
      "the king, \"Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go\r\n",
      "and fight with this Philistine.\"\n",
      "But Saul looked at David, and said, \"Thou art not able to go against\r\n",
      "this Philistine, to fight with him, for thou art but a youth, and he has\r\n",
      "been a man of war from his youth.\"\n",
      "Then David said to Saul, \"Once I was keeping my father's sheep, and\r\n",
      "there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock; and I\r\n",
      "went out after the lion, and struck him; and delivered the lamb out of\r\n",
      "his mouth, and when he arose against me, I caught him by the beard, and\r\n",
      "struck him, and slew him!\n",
      "Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear;\r\n",
      "and this Philistine shall be as one of them, for he hath defied the\r\n",
      "armies of the living God.\n",
      "The Lord, who delivered me out of the paw of\r\n",
      "the lion and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the\r\n",
      "hand of this Philistine.\"\n",
      "\"Go,\" said Saul, \"and the Lord be with thee!\"\n",
      "And he armed David with his own armour,--he put a helmet of brass upon\r\n",
      "his head, and armed him with a coat of mail.\n",
      "But when David girded his\r\n",
      "sword upon his armour, and tried to walk, he said to Saul, \"I cannot go\r\n",
      "with these, for I am not used to them.\"\n",
      "And he put them off.\n",
      "Then he took his staff in his hand and went and chose five smooth stones\r\n",
      "out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had; and his\r\n",
      "sling was in his hand; and he went out and drew near to the Philistine.\n",
      "And the Philistine came on and drew near to David; and the man that bore\r\n",
      "his shield went before him.\n",
      "And when the Philistine looked about and saw\r\n",
      "David, he disdained him, for David was but a boy, and ruddy, and of a\r\n",
      "fair countenance.\n",
      "And he said to David, \"Am I a dog, that thou comest to\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "When you stand round the Christmas tree and look longingly at the toys\r\n",
      "hanging from the prickly branches, it does not occur to you to ask why\r\n",
      "it is always this particular tree that is so honoured at Christmas.\n",
      "The\r\n",
      "dark green Fir looks so majestic when laden with bright toys and lit up\r\n",
      "by Christmas candles, that perhaps it is not easy to believe that it is\r\n",
      "the most modest of trees.\n",
      "But so it is, and because of its humility it\r\n",
      "was chosen to bear Christmas gifts to the children.\n",
      "This is the story:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the Christ Child was born, all people, animals, trees, and other\r\n",
      "plants felt that a great happiness had come into the world.\n",
      "And truly,\r\n",
      "the Heavenly Father had sent with the Holy Babe His blessings of Peace\r\n",
      "and Goodwill to all.\n",
      "Every day people came to see the sweet Babe,\r\n",
      "bringing presents in their hands.\n",
      "By the stable wherein lay the Christ\r\n",
      "Child stood three trees, and as the people came and went under their\r\n",
      "spreading branches, they thought that they, too, would like to give\r\n",
      "presents to the Child.\n",
      "Said the Palm, \"I will choose my biggest leaf and place it as a fan\r\n",
      "beside the manger to waft soft air to the Child.\"\n",
      "\"And I,\" said the Olive, \"I will sprinkle sweet-smelling oil over Him.\"\n",
      "\"What can I give to the Child?\"\n",
      "asked the Fir.\n",
      "\"You?\"\n",
      "said the others.\n",
      "\"You have nothing to offer.\n",
      "Your needles would\r\n",
      "prick the wee Babe, and your tears are sticky.\"\n",
      "This made the poor Fir very unhappy indeed, and it said, sadly, \"Yes,\r\n",
      "you are right.\n",
      "I have nothing that would be good enough to offer to the\r\n",
      "Christ Child.\"\n",
      "Now, quite near to the trees had stood an Angel, who had heard all that\r\n",
      "had passed.\n",
      "He was moved to pity the Fir, who was so lowly and without\r\n",
      "envy of the other trees, and he resolved to help it.\n",
      "High in the dark of the heavens the stars were beginning to twinkle, and\r\n",
      "the Angel begged some of the little ones to come down and rest upon the\r\n",
      "branches of the Fir.\n",
      "This they were glad to do, and their silvery light\r\n",
      "shone among the branches just like Christmas candles.\n",
      "From where He lay\r\n",
      "the Christ Child could see the great dark evening world and the darker\r\n",
      "forms of the trees keeping watch, like faithful guardians, beside the\r\n",
      "open door of the stable; and to its delight the Fir Tree saw the face of\r\n",
      "the Babe illumined with a heavenly smile as He looked upon the twinkling\r\n",
      "lights.\n",
      "The Christ Child did not forget the lovely sight, and long afterward he\r\n",
      "bade that to celebrate His birthday there should be placed in every\r\n",
      "house a Fir Tree, which might be lit up with candles to shine for the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A costly Diamond, that had once sparkled in a lady's ring, lay in a\r\n",
      "field amid tall grasses and oxeye daisies.\n",
      "Just above it, was a big Dewdrop that clung timidly to a nodding\r\n",
      "grass-blade.\n",
      "Overhead, the blazing sun shone in all his noonday glory.\n",
      "Ever since the first pink blush of dawn, the modest Dewdrop had gazed\r\n",
      "fixedly down upon the rich gem, but feared to address a person of such\r\n",
      "exalted consequence.\n",
      "At last, a large Beetle, during his rambles, chanced to espy the\r\n",
      "Diamond, and he also recognised him to be some one of great rank and\r\n",
      "importance.\n",
      "\"Sire,\" he said, making a low bow, \"permit your humble servant to offer\r\n",
      "you greeting.\"\n",
      "\"Tha--nks,\" responded the Diamond in languid tones of affectation.\n",
      "As the Beetle raised his head from his profound bow, his gaze happened\r\n",
      "to alight upon the Dewdrop.\n",
      "\"A relative of yours, I presume, Sire?\"\n",
      "he remarked affably, waving one\r\n",
      "of his feelers in the direction of the Dewdrop.\n",
      "The Diamond burst into a rude, contemptuous laugh.\n",
      "\"Quite _too_ absurd, I declare!\"\n",
      "he exclaimed loftily.\n",
      "\"But there, what\r\n",
      "_can_ you expect from a low, grovelling beetle?\n",
      "Away, sir, pass on!\n",
      "Your\r\n",
      "very presence is distasteful to me.\n",
      "The _idea_ of placing ME upon the\r\n",
      "same level--in the same family, as a low-born, mean, insignificant,\r\n",
      "utterly valueless----\" Here the Diamond fairly choked for breath.\n",
      "\"But has he not beauty exactly like your own, Sire?\"\n",
      "the Beetle ventured\r\n",
      "to interpose, though with a very timid air.\n",
      "\"BEAU--TY!\"\n",
      "flashed the Diamond, with fine disdain--\"the impudent fellow\r\n",
      "merely apes and imitates ME.\n",
      "However, it is some small consolation to\r\n",
      "remember that 'Imitation is the sincerest flattery.'\n",
      "But, even\r\n",
      "_allowing_ him to possess it, mere beauty without _rank_ is ridiculous\r\n",
      "and worthless.\n",
      "A Boat without _water_--a Carriage, but no _horses_--a\r\n",
      "Well, but never a _winch_: such is beauty without rank and wealth!\n",
      "There\r\n",
      "is no _real worth_ apart from rank and wealth.\n",
      "Combine Beauty, Rank,\r\n",
      "_and_ Wealth, and you have the whole world at your feet.\n",
      "Now you know\r\n",
      "the secret of the world worshipping ME.\"\n",
      "And the Diamond sparkled and gleamed with vivid, violet flashes, so that\r\n",
      "the Beetle was glad to shade his eyes.\n",
      "The poor Dewdrop had listened silently to all that had passed, and felt\r\n",
      "so wounded, that at last he wished he never had been born.\n",
      "Slowly a\r\n",
      "bright tear fell and splashed the dust.\n",
      "Just then, a Skylark fluttered to the ground and eagerly darted his beak\r\n",
      "at the Diamond.\n",
      "\"Alas!\"\n",
      "he piped, with a great sob of disappointment.\n",
      "\"What I thought to\r\n",
      "be a precious dewdrop is only a worthless diamond.\n",
      "My throat is parched\r\n",
      "for want of water.\n",
      "I must die of thirst!\"\n",
      "\"Really?\n",
      "The world will never get over your loss,\" cruelly sneered the\r\n",
      "Diamond.\n",
      "But a sudden and noble resolve came to the Dewdrop.\n",
      "Deeply did he repent\r\n",
      "his foolish wish.\n",
      "_He could now lay down his life that the life of\r\n",
      "another might be saved!_\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"May _I_ help you, please?\"\n",
      "he gently asked.\n",
      "The Lark raised his drooping head.\n",
      "\"Oh, my precious, precious friend, if you will, you can save my life!\"\n",
      "\"Open your mouth then.\"\n",
      "And the Dewdrop slid from the blade of grass, tumbled into the parched\r\n",
      "beak, and was eagerly swallowed.\n",
      "\"Ah--well, well!\"\n",
      "pondered the Beetle as he continued his homeward way.\n",
      "\"I've been taught a lesson that I shall not easily forget.\n",
      "Yes, yes!\n",
      "Simple worth is far better than rank or wealth without modesty and\r\n",
